# Literate Programming

## Description

When writing up the results of research, how do we incorporate the results of scripts and calculations?

Manually typing results or copying & pasting of data is not reproducible. To
have a reproducible research document, we need to automate the process of
inserting results (code and data) into our documents (prose).

## IPython

The IPython notebook is an integrated environment where you can write prose and
execute sections of code.

## Dexy

Dexy is a project automation tool which runs code and inserts the results in a
document. (It does a lot of other things too.)
